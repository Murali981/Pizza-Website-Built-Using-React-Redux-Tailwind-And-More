  // is a regular controlled element (setUsername(e.target.value)) . We will always read the value from the username (value={username})
  // and each time when we type a new character we will update the local state by calling the setUsername() function given by the useState("")
  // hook. So we are basically temporarily storing the username right in the component itself because it is a very bad practice to basically
  // connect an input field to the redux store. So as we change the username here (or) as we type a new input here we should really update
  // a local state variable and not always update the redux store. Instead we only do that as soon as we submit the form. Basically as
  // we done inputting our username . So this has to be done in the handleSubmit(e) function . Both input (<input>) and the button(<button>)
  // elements are inside a <form> element . So therefore as soon as we click here to get the form submitted then we will use the handleSubmit(e)
  // function to hadling of connecting our input element to the redux store after submitting the input name using the form element.

    // created in the userSlice.js file. And to this updateName() action creator we will pass the local username state as
    // an argument to the updateName(username) action creator. Now this username will become the action.payload and then this
    // action.payload will be assigned to the state.username . And as soon as this happens the entire react application will get
    // rerendered and display this username everywhere in our react application.
    navigate("/menu"); // As soon as we submit our name by using the <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> then we will update our name in
    // the redux global store and then we will redirect the user to the "/menu" by using the useNavigate() hook provided by the
    // react-router-dom.
